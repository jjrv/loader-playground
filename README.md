# loader-playground

This is how a simple React app would look like if WebPack had never been invented. [See it live](https://jjrv.github.io/loader-playground/).
It uses [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs#readme) and [cresolve](https://github.com/charto/cresolve#readme).

Yes, the files you see above really are **all** there is to this project. There are no hidden install or build steps or servers.

It initially loads slowly, because this is the development version, but then reloads fast. The initial load time should be compared with
the time it takes to run `npm install` on a typical starter project. This should then compare rather favorably.
